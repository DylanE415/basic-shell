A basic shell I made in python. 
use python >3.9, pip install requirements.txt
If on a mac you can use the vim command.
Can run any executables that you have on your PATH, enter type "command" to see what is executable.
ex: /Users/dylaneilber/Desktop/personal_projects $ type git
git is /opt/homebrew/bin/git
